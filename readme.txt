Make widgets mobile. A bigger click area and cleaner look for 8 default widgets.

== Description ==

* Gives Bootstrap styles to widgets: "Categories," "Archives," "Pages," "Search," "Recent Posts," "Recent Comments," "Meta," and "Tag Cloud."
* Fast: must have Bootstrap 3 because it only sends one small file to the browser.
* Disable plugin for certain widgets, using "Settings" page.
* Works with all widgets in Bootstrap themes "evolve," and "Unite." Mostly works on "Ward" (except for "Categories"), "Bootstrap Ultimate" (except for "Pages") "DevDmBootstrap3" (except for "Search"). Doesn't work at all on "The Bootstrap," "Radiant," "Customizr," and "Inkzine."
* Doesn't work if you have more than one of each kind of widget on a page. For example, two "Categories" widgets.
* No setup needed, unless you want to disable it for certain widgets.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the bootstrap-widget-styling directory to your /wp-content/plugins directory.
1. In the "Plugins" menu, find "Bootstrap Widget Styling," and click "Activate."
1. If you would like to disable the plugin for certain widgets, click "Settings."

Twitter Bootstrap 3.

= Will this change the rest of my page's styles? =
No, this doesn't output any stylesheets. It only formats widgets so they can use Bootstrap styles.

== Screenshots ==
